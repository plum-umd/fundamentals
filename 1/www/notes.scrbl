Today's quiz:

A @tt{Coord} is a @tt{(make-posn Integer Integer)}.
Interp: a point on the Cartesian plane.

Write a function @tt{dist : Coord -> Number} that computes the
distance from the origin.

Recall: distance of (x,y) to (0,0) is √(x²+y²).

You do not need to perform all steps of the DR, just define the
function.

We didn't really write any code; we discussed templates, stubs, the
three kinds of errors, and failing test cases.

Here are some common issues encountered so far in grading
@secref{assign3}:

@itemize[

@item{Most students place test cases below their def'n
  instead of between signature and def'n.}

@item{ Some people included function examples in comments
  without writing concrete test cases. Some had both.}

@item{Almost @bold{every} submission had some incorrect
  indentation and long lines.}

@item{The format-month almost universally lacked helper
  usage and contained long lines.}

@item{Some students defined "helpers" that didn't "help" at
  all, basically like:
  @verbatim{
    (define (supposed-to-implement x)
      (so-called-helper x))
      }
      }

@item{Many submission had stubs still left in their code either as a
  comment or as a defined function like @tt{(define (format-month-stub
  ...) "Nov")}. I don't think students understand what a stub is.}

@item{There were lots of submissions with just templates defined for
  every function, or data templates that were just wrong.}

@item{General disorganization was common, e.g. signatures and test
  cases thrown about randomly and not coupled together with the
  function def'n. Some people renamed the functions to something else
  which made it difficult to grade.}

@item{Lots of long functions bodies were defined on the same line as
  the "define".}

@item{Commonly @tt{init-time} was defined as a function instead of
  just as an expression in terms of @tt{init-*} constants.}

@item{A surpisingly amount of submission weren't even grammatically
  well-formed BSL programs. :(}

Make sure you correct any of these issue if they occur in your program
for @secref{assign4}.
